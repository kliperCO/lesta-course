.TH SDL_WaitEventTimeout 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_WaitEventTimeout \- Wait until the specified timeout (in milliseconds) for the next available event\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_WaitEventTimeout(SDL_Event *event, Sint32 timeoutMS);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.BR event
is not NULL, the next event is removed from the queue and stored
in the 
.BR SDL_Event
 structure pointed to by
.BR event
\[char46]

As this function may implicitly call 
.BR SDL_PumpEvents
(),
you can only call this function in the thread that initialized the video
subsystem\[char46]

The timeout is not guaranteed, the actual wait time could be longer due to
system scheduling\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I event
the 
.BR SDL_Event
 structure to be filled in with the next event from the queue, or NULL
.TP
.I timeoutMS
the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for the next available event
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 1 on success or 0 if there was an error while waiting for events;
call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46] This also returns
0 if the timeout elapsed without an event arriving\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
