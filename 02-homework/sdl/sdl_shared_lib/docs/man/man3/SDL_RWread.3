.TH SDL_RWread 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_RWread \- Read from a data source\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Sint64 SDL_RWread(SDL_RWops *context, void *ptr, Sint64 size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function reads up
.BR size
bytes from the data source to the area
pointed at by
.BR ptr
\[char46] This function may read less bytes than requested\[char46] It
will return zero when the data stream is completely read, or -1 on error\[char46]
For streams that support non-blocking operation, if nothing was read
because it would require blocking, this function returns -2 to distinguish
that this is not an error or end-of-file, and the caller can try again
later\[char46]


.BR SDL_RWread
() is actually a function wrapper that calls the

.BR SDL_RWops
's
.BR read
method appropriately, to simplify
application development\[char46]

It is an error to specify a negative
.BR size
, but this parameter is signed
so you definitely cannot overflow the return value on a successful run with
enormous amounts of data\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I context
a pointer to an 
.BR SDL_RWops
 structure
.TP
.I ptr
a pointer to a buffer to read data into
.TP
.I size
the number of bytes to read from the data source\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes read, 0 at end of file, -1 on error, and -2 for
data not ready with a non-blocking context\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
