.SH DESCRIPTION
Newly-opened audio devices start in the paused state, so you must call this
function after opening the specified audio device to start playing sound\[char46]
This allows you to safely initialize data for your callback function after
opening the audio device\[char46] Silence will be written to the audio device while
paused, and the audio callback is guaranteed to not be called\[char46] Pausing one
device does not prevent other unpaused devices from running their
callbacks\[char46]
