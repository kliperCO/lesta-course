# SDL_SemWait

Wait until a semaphore has a positive value and then decrements it.

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_SemWait(SDL_sem *sem);

```

## Function Parameters

|             |                       |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| **sem**     | the semaphore wait on |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This function suspends the calling thread until either the semaphore
pointed to by `sem` has a positive value or the call is interrupted by a
signal or error. If the call is successful it will atomically decrement the
semaphore value.

This function is the equivalent of calling
[SDL_SemWaitTimeout](SDL_SemWaitTimeout)() with a time length of
[`SDL_MUTEX_MAXWAIT`](SDL_MUTEX_MAXWAIT).

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
