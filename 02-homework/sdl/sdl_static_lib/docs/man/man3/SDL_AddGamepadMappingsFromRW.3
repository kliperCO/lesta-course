.TH SDL_AddGamepadMappingsFromRW 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_AddGamepadMappingsFromRW \- Load a set of gamepad mappings from a seekable SDL data stream\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_AddGamepadMappingsFromRW(SDL_RWops *rw, int freerw);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You can call this function several times, if needed, to load different
database files\[char46]

If a new mapping is loaded for an already known gamepad GUID, the later
version will overwrite the one currently loaded\[char46]

Mappings not belonging to the current platform or with no platform field
specified will be ignored (i\[char46]e\[char46] mappings for Linux will be ignored in
Windows, etc)\[char46]

This function will load the text database entirely in memory before
processing it, so take this into consideration if you are in a memory
constrained environment\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I rw
the data stream for the mappings to be added
.TP
.I freerw
non-zero to close the stream after being read
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of mappings added or -1 on error; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
