.SH NAME
SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions \- Get the names of the Vulkan instance extensions needed to create a surface with 
.BR SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface
\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_bool SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions(unsigned int *pCount,
.BI "                                          const char **pNames);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This should be called after either calling

.BR SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary
() or creating an

.BR SDL_Window
 with the 
.BR
.BR SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN
flag\[char46]

If
.BR pNames
is NULL, then the number of required Vulkan instance extensions
is returned in
.BR pCount
\[char46] Otherwise,
.BR pCount
must point to a variable set
to the number of elements in the
.BR pNames
array, and on return the variable
is overwritten with the number of names actually written to
.BR pNames
\[char46] If
.BR pCount
is less than the number of required extensions, at most
.BR pCount
structures will be written\[char46] If
.BR pCount
is smaller than the number of
required extensions, 
.BR SDL_FALSE
 will be returned instead of

.BR SDL_TRUE
, to indicate that not all the required extensions were
returned\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I pCount
A pointer to an unsigned int corresponding to the number of extensions to be returned
.TP
.I pNames
NULL or a pointer to an array to be filled with required Vulkan instance extensions
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 
.BR SDL_TRUE
 on success, 
.BR SDL_FALSE
 on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
