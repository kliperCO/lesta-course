.TH SDL_RenderFlush 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_RenderFlush \- Force the rendering context to flush any pending commands to the underlying rendering API\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_RenderFlush(SDL_Renderer *renderer);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You do not need to (and in fact, shouldn't) call this function unless you
are planning to call into OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/whatever directly in
addition to using an 
.BR SDL_Renderer
\[char46]

This is for a very-specific case: if you are using SDL's render API, you
asked for a specific renderer backend (OpenGL, Direct3D, etc), you set

.BR SDL_HINT_RENDER_BATCHING
 to "1", and you plan
to make OpenGL/D3D/whatever calls in addition to SDL render API calls\[char46] If
all of this applies, you should call 
.BR SDL_RenderFlush
()
between calls to SDL's render API and the low-level API you're using in
cooperation\[char46]

In all other cases, you can ignore this function\[char46] This is only here to get
maximum performance out of a specific situation\[char46] In all other cases, SDL
will do the right thing, perhaps at a performance loss\[char46]

This function is first available in SDL 2\[char46]0\[char46]10, and is not needed in 2\[char46]0\[char46]9
and earlier, as earlier versions did not queue rendering commands at all,
instead flushing them to the OS immediately\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I renderer
the rendering context
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
