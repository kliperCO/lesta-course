.SH NAME
SDL_LoadWAV_RW \- Load the audio data of a WAVE file into memory\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq

.BI "SDL_AudioSpec* SDL_LoadWAV_RW(SDL_RWops * src,
.BI "                              int freesrc,

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Loading a WAVE file requires
.BR src
,
.BR spec
,
.BR audio_buf
and
.BR audio_len
to
be valid pointers\[char46] The entire data portion of the file is then loaded into
memory and decoded if necessary\[char46]

If
.BR freesrc
is non-zero, the data source gets automatically closed and
freed before the function returns\[char46]

Supported formats are RIFF WAVE files with the formats PCM (8, 16, 24, and
32 bits), IEEE Float (32 bits), Microsoft ADPCM and IMA ADPCM (4 bits), and
A-law and mu-law (8 bits)\[char46] Other formats are currently unsupported and
cause an error\[char46]

If this function succeeds, the pointer returned by it is equal to
.BR spec
and the pointer to the audio data allocated by the function is written to
.BR audio_buf
and its length in bytes to
.BR audio_len
\[char46] The

.BR SDL_AudioSpec
 members
.BR freq
,
.BR channels
, and
.BR format
are
set to the values of the audio data in the buffer\[char46] The
.BR samples
member is
set to a sane default and all others are set to zero\[char46]

It's necessary to use 
.BR SDL_free
() to free the audio data
returned in
.BR audio_buf
when it is no longer used\[char46]

Because of the underspecification of the \[char46]WAV format, there are many
problematic files in the wild that cause issues with strict decoders\[char46] To
provide compatibility with these files, this decoder is lenient in regards
to the truncation of the file, the fact chunk, and the size of the RIFF
chunk\[char46] The hints

.BR
.BR SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE
,

.BR
.BR SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION
, and

.BR
.BR SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK
can be used to tune
the behavior of the loading process\[char46]

Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values in
the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error\[char46] Additionally, any
critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading process
with an error\[char46] The function returns NULL on error and in all cases (with
the exception of
.BR src
being NULL), an appropriate error message will be
set\[char46]

It is required that the data source supports seeking\[char46]

Example:
.BR 

.BR c
SDL_LoadWAV_RW(SDL_RWFromFile("sample\[char46]wav", "rb"), 1, &spec, &buf, &len);


.BR 
Note that the 
.BR SDL_LoadWAV
 macro does this same thing for
you, but in a less messy way:
.BR 

.BR c
SDL_LoadWAV("sample\[char46]wav", &spec, &buf, &len);


.BR 

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I src
The data source for the WAVE data
.TP
.I freesrc
If non-zero, SDL will _always_ free the data source
.TP
.I spec
An 
.BR SDL_AudioSpec
 that will be filled in with the wave file's format details
.TP
.I audio_buf
A pointer filled with the audio data, allocated by the function\[char46]
.TP
.I audio_len
A pointer filled with the length of the audio data buffer in bytes
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns This function, if successfully called, returns
.BR spec
, which will
be filled with the audio data format of the wave source data\[char46]
.BR audio_buf
will be filled with a pointer to an allocated buffer containing the audio
data, and
.BR audio_len
is filled with the length of that audio buffer in
bytes\[char46]

This function returns NULL if the \[char46]WAV file cannot be opened, uses an
unknown data format, or is corrupt; call 
.BR SDL_GetError
() for
more information\[char46]

When the application is done with the data returned in
.BR audio_buf
, it
should call 
.BR SDL_free
() to dispose of it\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
