.TH SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize \- Get the number of bytes of still-queued audio\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Uint32 SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize(SDL_AudioDeviceID dev);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For playback devices: this is the number of bytes that have been queued for
playback with 
.BR SDL_QueueAudio
(), but have not yet been
sent to the hardware\[char46]

Once we've sent it to the hardware, this function can not decide the exact
byte boundary of what has been played\[char46] It's possible that we just gave the
hardware several kilobytes right before you called this function, but it
hasn't played any of it yet, or maybe half of it, etc\[char46]

For capture devices, this is the number of bytes that have been captured by
the device and are waiting for you to dequeue\[char46] This number may grow at any
time, so this only informs of the lower-bound of available data\[char46]

You may not queue or dequeue audio on a device that is using an
application-supplied callback; calling this function on such a device
always returns 0\[char46] You have to use the audio callback or queue audio, but
not both\[char46]

You should not call 
.BR SDL_LockAudio
() on the device before
querying; SDL handles locking internally for this function\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dev
the device ID of which we will query queued audio size
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes (not samples!) of queued audio\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
