.TH SDL_ClearQueuedAudio 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_ClearQueuedAudio \- Drop any queued audio data waiting to be sent to the hardware\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_ClearQueuedAudio(SDL_AudioDeviceID dev);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Immediately after this call,

.BR SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize
() will return 0\[char46] For
output devices, the hardware will start playing silence if more audio isn't
queued\[char46] For capture devices, the hardware will start filling the empty
queue with new data if the capture device isn't paused\[char46]

This will not prevent playback of queued audio that's already been sent to
the hardware, as we can not undo that, so expect there to be some fraction
of a second of audio that might still be heard\[char46] This can be useful if you
want to, say, drop any pending music or any unprocessed microphone input
during a level change in your game\[char46]

You may not queue or dequeue audio on a device that is using an
application-supplied callback; calling this function on such a device
always returns 0\[char46] You have to use the audio callback or queue audio, but
not both\[char46]

You should not call 
.BR SDL_LockAudio
() on the device before
clearing the queue; SDL handles locking internally for this function\[char46]

This function always succeeds and thus returns void\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I dev
the device ID of which to clear the audio queue
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
