.TH SDL_GetNumAudioDevices 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetNumAudioDevices \- Get the number of built-in audio devices\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetNumAudioDevices(int iscapture);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is only valid after successfully initializing the audio
subsystem\[char46]

Note that audio capture support is not implemented as of SDL 2\[char46]0\[char46]4, so the
.BR iscapture
parameter is for future expansion and should always be zero for
now\[char46]

This function will return -1 if an explicit list of devices can't be
determined\[char46] Returning -1 is not an error\[char46] For example, if SDL is set up to
talk to a remote audio server, it can't list every one available on the
Internet, but it will still allow a specific host to be specified in

.BR SDL_OpenAudioDevice
()\[char46]

In many common cases, when this function returns a value <= 0, it can still
successfully open the default device (NULL for first argument of

.BR SDL_OpenAudioDevice
())\[char46]

This function may trigger a complete redetect of available hardware\[char46] It
should not be called for each iteration of a loop, but rather once at the
start of a loop:
.BR 

.BR c
// Don't do this:
for (int i = 0; i < SDL_GetNumAudioDevices(0); i++)

// do this instead:
const int count = SDL_GetNumAudioDevices(0);
for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) { do_something_here(); }


.BR 

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I iscapture
zero to request playback devices, non-zero to request recording devices
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of available devices exposed by the current driver or -1
if an explicit list of devices can't be determined\[char46] A return value of -1
does not necessarily mean an error condition\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
