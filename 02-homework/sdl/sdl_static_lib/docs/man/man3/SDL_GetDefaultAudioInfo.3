.TH SDL_GetDefaultAudioInfo 3 "SDL 3.0.0" "SDL" "SDL3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
SDL_GetDefaultAudioInfo \- Get the name and preferred format of the default audio device\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3/SDL.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int SDL_GetDefaultAudioInfo(char **name,
.BI "                            SDL_AudioSpec *spec,
.BI "                            int iscapture);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Some (but not all!) platforms have an isolated mechanism to get information
about the "default" device\[char46] This can actually be a completely different
device that's not in the list you get from

.BR SDL_GetAudioDeviceSpec
()\[char46] It can even be a
network address! (This is discussed in

.BR SDL_OpenAudioDevice
()\[char46])

As a result, this call is not guaranteed to be performant, as it can query
the sound server directly every time, unlike the other query functions\[char46] You
should call this function sparingly!
.BR spec
will be filled with the sample rate, sample format, and channel
count, if a default device exists on the system\[char46] If
.BR name
is provided,
will be filled with either a dynamically-allocated UTF-8 string or NULL\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I name
A pointer to be filled with the name of the default device (can be NULL)\[char46] Please call 
.BR SDL_free
() when you are done with this pointer!
.TP
.I spec
The 
.BR SDL_AudioSpec
 to be initialized by this function\[char46]
.TP
.I iscapture
non-zero to query the default recording device, zero to query the default output device\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

.BR SDL_GetError
() for more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
